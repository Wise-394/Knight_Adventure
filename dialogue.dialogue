Villager: Oh, thank the gods! A knight at last! Please, you must help me!

Knight: is there anything I could help you with? You seem in great distress.

Villager: A monster... a terrible beast stole the ring I was going to propose with! I had planned to ask my love to marry me, but now... It’s gone, and without it, I can never show her how much she means to me.

Knight: That is awful!

Villager: Please, I beg of you, noble knight! The ring is my only hope! The monster fled to the fire region, but to reach it, you must first cross the forest, then the icy lands, and finally, the fire region itself. If I don’t get that ring back, I’ll lose her forever.

Knight: I will not let you suffer. I will retrieve the ring, no matter the danger.

Villager: Please, you must hurry! The path is treacherous—through the forest, across the ice, and into the heart of the fire region. It’s dangerous, but you are my only hope!

Knight: I will face whatever dangers come my way. Your love will not be lost.

Villager: Thank you, knight. If you succeed... I will be forever in your debt. Please... return the ring to me. It’s the only way I can show her my heart.
